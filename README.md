This repository provides source code for input generation. Two identical source code files are provided:

1. Form2Flow.py - for building the app
2. Form2Flow.ipynb - to edit the code in Jupyter Notebook (separated into blocks)

4 input files - control.cin, lpt.cin, mdmap.cin, and infodom.cin are automatically generated after the user fills in the form.
To understand the flow of the code, please download the attachment.
