### ðŸ¤– Application Deployment for Environmental Modelling
As a Research Assistant, I was involved in modifying simulation code for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These simulations are used to model and improve indoor air quality. For my contribution to the project, I successfully designed and deployed a desktop application, which automates the creation of inputs for the CFD simulator.

This repository provides source code for input generation. Two identical source code files are provided:

1. Form2Flow.py - for building the app
2. Form2Flow.ipynb - to edit the code in Jupyter Notebook (separated into blocks)

4 input files - control.cin, lpt.cin, mdmap.cin, and infodom.cin are automatically generated after the user fills in the form.
Click below to understand the flow of the code.
